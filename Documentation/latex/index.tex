This is the final project for A\+D2 -\/ P\+IG discipline. Here we have the code for a clock with two hour arrows, each one corresponds to a different timezone\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The main arrow is based in Manaus/\+America timezone (-\/3 U\+TC).
\item The red arrow is based in whatever country the user picked (availiable on the json file)
\item In the json file you can choose one in 20 locations
