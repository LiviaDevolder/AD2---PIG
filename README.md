This is the final project for AD2 - PIG discipline. Here we have the code for a clock with two hour arrows, each one corresponds to a different timezone:

- The main arrow is based in Manaus/America timezone (-3 UTC).

- The red arrow is based in whatever country the user picked (availiable on the json file)

- In the json file you can choose one in 20 locations

- The graphic interface was made with Tkinter lib
